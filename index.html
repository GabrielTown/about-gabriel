	<p>
		background-color: lightblue;
		Hi, my name is Gabriel Town. I'm from a really small town in Iowa called Milo. There's no stop lights there,
		but there is gas station there so that's cool. Small towns are really awesome, but unfortunately some people can
		be a little nosey.

		I moved to Albuquerque about three years ago. It's alright, but it's where my son was born. He's cool and a very
		good looking kid! Plus he has great teeth.
